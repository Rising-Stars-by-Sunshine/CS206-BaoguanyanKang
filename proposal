1. Abstract:
Amidst the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, traditional game theory's static models falter in accurately simulating the dynamic strategic interactions between defenders and attackers. This paper argues, as supported by Camerer (2003), that conventional approaches inadequately capture the complexities of real-time adaptation and information asymmetry inherent in cybersecurity conflicts. To address this shortfall, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Game Theoretic (DAGT) model that encapsulates the continuous strategic evolution of cybersecurity agents. Our DAGT model allows defenders to iteratively refine their security postures in response to changing attack methodologies, while attackers concurrently adapt their tactics to navigate defensive barriers and remain undetected. By leveraging the principles of evolutionary game theory and algorithmic behavioral analysis, the DAGT model exhibits enhanced predictive power and strategic depth. Through a series of simulated interactions, we demonstrate that the DAGT approach significantly fortifies defense mechanisms and improves resilience against cyber threats. This study extends beyond theoretical advancements, presenting a pragmatic framework for developing more responsive and adaptive cybersecurity strategies in contrast to the limitations of traditional static models. 
2. Introduction:
The paper critiques traditional game theory's limitations in capturing the dynamic and complex nature of strategic interactions, particularly in cybersecurity contexts where information is incomplete and agents are diverse. Traditional models result in suboptimal strategies and inaccurate predictions. The DAGT model is introduced as a solution, emphasizing its ability to allow real-time strategic evolution and adaptation in ongoing cybersecurity conflicts.
