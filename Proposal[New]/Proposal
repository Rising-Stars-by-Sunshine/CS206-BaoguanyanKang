1.Summarize the Background/Motivation
Gaps in Existing Literature:
Current game theory models, particularly those applied in cybersecurity, typically rely on static assumptions and fail to account for the dynamic nature of strategic interactions where information is asymmetric and agents (both human and AI) continuously adapt. These models do not adequately simulate the real-time adaptation processes or the complexity of interactions between heterogeneous agents, as emphasized in traditional game theory. These gaps are pronounced in the face of advanced persistent threats in cybersecurity, where attackers continuously evolve their strategies to bypass static defenses.

2.Research Questions
What are the questions that your research intends to answer?
How can Dynamic Adaptive Game Theory (DAGT) enhance the adaptability of cybersecurity defenses against evolving cyber threats?
What role do AI agents play in modifying the strategic landscape of cybersecurity defenses using DAGT?
Why are these questions important?
These questions address critical vulnerabilities in traditional cybersecurity approaches that fail to keep pace with sophisticated, rapidly evolving cyber threats.
Understanding AI's role in cybersecurity through DAGT could lead to more robust, adaptive security systems that protect critical digital infrastructures.
Why are the questions not answered by existing game theory literature?
Traditional game theory does not sufficiently model the continual adaptation of strategies and real-time decision-making required in modern cybersecurity contexts, where threats and defenses evolve concurrently.

3.Application Scenario
Real-World Application: The DAGT model applies to scenarios like online financial transactions where traditional static defenses often fall short. Implementing DAGT allows for real-time adaptation and proactive defense against novel cyber attacks.
Interdisciplinary Foundations: Insights from behavioral psychology can inform the development of DAGT by understanding how human and AI agents might predictably react to changes in the game's structure or the opponentâ€™s strategies, enhancing the model's realism and applicability.

4.Methodology
Theoretical Framework: The research builds upon evolutionary game theory and mechanism design, focusing on dynamic and adaptive strategies in cybersecurity.
Analytical Tools: The study employs algorithmic behavioral analysis and simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of DAGT strategies in real-time scenarios.
Technology and Insights Integration: By integrating AI learning algorithms and predictive modeling, the approach allows cybersecurity systems to anticipate and react to potential threats dynamically.

5.Preliminary Results
Illustration Example: In simulations involving AI-driven anomaly detection for online transactions, the DAGT model demonstrated a significant reduction in successful cyber attacks, thereby enhancing the resilience of financial systems and protecting user data more effectively than static models.

6.Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts
Limitations Inspiring Future Research: While the DAGT model addresses dynamic adaptation, it may not fully account for multi-agent coordination complexities or global policy impacts, which could be explored in future studies.
Application to Strategic Decisions: The research findings could influence how organizations, from private corporations to government agencies, develop and implement more flexible, responsive cybersecurity strategies. By understanding the dynamic interactions modeled by DAGT, these entities can better prepare for and respond to evolving threats.
